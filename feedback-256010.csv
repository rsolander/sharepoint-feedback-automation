Muslims "" Uyghurs"" in Xinjiang, an autonomous region located in northwest China, are being severely tortured, used for organ harvesting, separated from their families, and detained in ""re-education"" camps. 
They are forced to hail communism and the communist party, are injected with anti-fertility drugs for sterilization, and are being forced to speak in a different language than their mother tongue.
Various media reports and research from Amnesty International found that Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim people in Xinjiang are facing discrimination and severe restrictions on the right to freedom of religion. These include forcing restaurants to stay open and that access to mosques is restricted during Ramadan. Government employees are prohibited to observe Ramadan. Since March 2017, the Chinese authorities have banned the wearing of burqas and having an “abnormal” beards.

Due to how broad my resume is I believe your automated systems may be filtering me out as a potential candidate and I would like the opportunity to speak with a hiring manager if possible. I have been trying to reach out to someone at Rockwell for months and I think my skill set would be a great addition to the successful day-to-day running at Rockwell Automation. I can be reached anytime directly at 262.864.1589 or email jacob.v.universe@gmail.com. My direct line is 262-484-2379 if you wish to speak with me immediately without getting a call back. Although giving feedback is a little unorthodox to land a job interview I thought perhaps it may reflect how serious I am about becoming part of your team. I hope to hear back and thank you for your time!

Warm Regards,

I have some feedback for you:
1. Sometimes the search field for the literature library does not appear when I go to the link.  Just the background image is there.
2. Data sheet 1606-SR020 seems to have an error in it; it is for a 5A 24V DC power supply but the data sheet has the output ratings at 10A.  The document number also appears as ""10000126350 (00)"" instead of ""1606-SR020"".  Maybe some version control issues there.

Let me know if you need any further info please on cpharris@nhp.com.au

Thanks,

Chris Harris","cpharris@nhp.com.au"

We are the RA distributor in Solon, OH.  Ever since the product lifecycle page has updated to the new interface, the information it provides is not accurate.  There are catalog numbers that do not show up any more.  Another example is that certain end of life products are stated as discontinued instead of providing the EoL date.  For example, the 800T-XAP is showing discontinued, but it is actually still available for sale.  This site also used to recommend a replacement product, but not anymore.  Another example, 800F-MN3BX10 is discontinued.  The old lifecycle page used to recommend 800F-MN3WX10 (white LED instead of blue).  The new page says no replacement available.  I used to use this page quite a bit, but every time I use it now, it provides incorrect info on many items.  A lot of the older part numbers don't show up in ProposalWorks either.  I end up having to use my physical catalog to cross stuff over.  It can be time consuming.","karthik.sethuraman@rexelusa.com"

The old PLS tool was the most useful way to find migration paths since, when a product is obsolete, you guys remove the products from the catalog page and watermark ""obsolete"" across it (helping a total of 0 people, including RA tech support).  Thus, PLS was sometimes the only way other than going on rexel.com to find a catalog and, ultimately, a migration path.  The new AB.com might eventually work well, but there is NO WAY that you guys should have changed the PLS tool.  I am absolutely deflated because now I have to rely on the absolute GARBAGE results of CrossWorks (crowdsourcing is clearly not working, guys),which I then have to correct since they're almost always wrong.  That, or I can rely on the least effective search engine in the industry, Seismic.

Can you please improve the search algorithm in the Literature Library?  I have tried a few times searching for an exact document number (at least the start of it) to see if there is an updated version of it, but it does not appear on even the first screen, let alone the first entry.

Eg, try searching for ""750-TD001"", the tech data on 750 series drives.  I had to tick the ""Technical Data"" document type just to locate it in the search results.  It should be the first entry.

Let me know if you want any further details, my email is cpharris@nhp.com.au

Thanks,

Chris Harris","cpharris@nhp.com.au"

If this was an isolated incident ok but its very common. The organizational layout of this site and the number of broken links are ridiculous. Rockwell equipment itself is generally easy to set up but that is overshadowed by the horrible time we go through trying to get something from this site. I have been using Rockwell products almost exclusively for 35 years and I have watched a decline for some time regarding the efficiency in which I can find documents and software.

The sooner,the better.I have a strong background in boolean logic (AND/OR),so I am keen to start asap this basic training.
Henry Ford said that you must learn until your death.I have nothing to lose except TIME.And TIME is not on my side.
It's my fault that I didn't requested this training 5 years earlier.In Romania I work at the Craiova Engine plant & I have a small job opportunity to promote as PLC specialist.I can't find words to say THANKS to Iva & uou,because you both don't know me.
Thanks for your attention & increased profit for Rockwell Automation.
Kind regards,
